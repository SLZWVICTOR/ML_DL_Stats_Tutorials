# ML_DL_Stats_Tutorials
The adoption of Machine learning (including deep learning) and advanced statistical methods can be made easier with well-documented tutorials. This repo intends to provide detailed tutorials on the use of ML/DL/Stats framworks/packages (Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, H2O.ai, pymc3) for machine learning, deep learning and bayesian statistics(such as MCMC). 

In addition, there are miscellaneous tutorials on many different but relevant aspects. Below are a brief summary:
(1) Optimization
(2) Time-series analysis
(3) Pytorch
(4) Pyro
(5) Cython
(6) Monte Carlo simulation
(7) Bootstrap
(8) Reinforcement learning
(9) OpenAI
(10) Others
